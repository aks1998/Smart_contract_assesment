# Ethereum Token using Solidity

This Solidity program is a simple "Token creation" program that demonstrates mint and burn function. The purpose of this program is to demostrate a working of token using solidity programming and serve as a starting point for those who are new to Solidity and want to get a feel for how it works.

## Description

This program is a simple contract Token written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has a mint and burn function that add or delete a token while performing it. In this program a mint function that takes two parameters: an address and a value. The function then increases the total supply by that number and increases the balance of the address by that amount. Further, a burn function, which works the opposite of the mint function, as it will destroy tokens. It will take an address and value just like the mint functions. It will then deduct the value from the total supply and from the balance of the address.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

### Executing program

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., Final Assessment.sol). Then,
To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile Final Assessment.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. S

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it.
